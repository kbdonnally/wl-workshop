# Slide 1: Intro

- Lettering: green text, black border, large size, sans-serif
- This styling, as written, is an inherent part of what I wrote. My hand shaped the letters; the ink made the colors.
- So how do I do this on a screen?

- Let's look at *what* was actually written:
    1. Content: "Katherine"
    2. Styles: text color, border info, size, what font we're using

- Digitized text is literally just that: identifying things about a piece of text and figuring out how to write that in a way computers understand.

- It separates the *content* of what you're writing from *how it looks*. (Just like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint.)

- Everything is text! Browsers are just big ole' text readers.

# Slide 2: What's in a webpage?

- Ingredients:
    - HTML = buckets for text
    - CSS = "paint-by-numbers" instructions
    - Browser = paints the text buckets using those instructions

(There's also this thing called "JavaScript," which basically helps people make cool interactions with motion or timing, but we don't need to worry about that at all right now. Things that required JavaScript 5 years ago, like animation, can be done with CSS now because the future is here.)

# Slide 3: [Annotated Definitions]

- Explain what HTML, CSS, and JS actually stand for.

# Slide 4: HTML: A Closer Look

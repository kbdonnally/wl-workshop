# image annotations

- basename: 01-intro
  summary: >
    Illustration: hand-drawn text. Concept: how to
    transfer that text to the computer with same properties.

- basename: 02-intro-w-notes
  summary: >
    Some extra explainer notes on the first pic.

- basename: 03-html
  summary: >
    Demo of HTML document with comments on what things
    mean. Shows both head and body. Pair with
    that weird slide that labels sections/elements. (Explain
    elements here.)

- basename: 04-css
  summary: >
    More details on how to translate drawing from #1 into
    code. Explains how basic CSS syntax looks, but not classes
    or IDs. Explains concept of CSS more.

- basename: 05-filepaths
  summary: >
    Simple file tree, simple node tree. Detailed explainer on filepaths
    as a concept. Maybe go over this at the end of HTML, since have to link
    to another file? Unsure.

- basename: 06-node-tree
  summary: >
    Complicated file tree, node tree, and syntax of how to navigate between file
    locations. More difficult to comprehend than I thought at first - be careful
    with this part. Maybe don't combine it with the site structure thing? Make
    the directory names super literal?

- basename: 07-read-html
  summary: >
    This is the one that should pair with #3.

- basename: 08-selectors
  summary: >
    This also should go up by #3, for top half. Bottom half is CSS, 
    so cover that after the CSS basics in #4.

- basename: 10-site-files
  summary: >
    Complicated site file tree, explaining how websites are usually structured.
    Nothing that people need to know; it's just something that's helpful to 
    have when you start looking at other people's projects and trying to figure 
    out what they mean. Show towards end.

- basename: 12-mockup-to-css
  summary: >
    Towards very end: make a mockup of what you want, and make it into fake 
    HTML for structure. Then, take that structure and use it to make your 
    CSS classes. That way, it'll make sense to you because you're using the
    words that made sense to describe the block in the first place. After that,
    BEM system kicks in.

- basename: 13-mockup-to-html
  summary: >
    Combine HTML structure with CSS structure that you've created.
    This is another one that turns out to be ridiculously complicated
    upon looking at it... Show at very end so they see how it's all put
    together, but by no means do people need to grasp this fully.
